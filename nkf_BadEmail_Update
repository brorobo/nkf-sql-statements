/*
Stored Procedure nkf_BadEmail_update is scheduled, but fails each time:
Msg 1934, Level 16, State 1, Procedure nkf_BadEmail_update, Line 4
DELETE failed because the following SET options have incorrect settings: 'ANSI_NULLS, QUOTED_IDENTIFIER'. Verify that SET options are correct for use with indexed views and/or indexes on computed columns and/or filtered indexes and/or query notifications and/or XML data type methods and/or spatial index operations.

Checked Stackoverflow for the error, and noticed that the code at the beginning of the stored procedure is different than for most others.

nkf_BadEmail_update:
USE [prod_imis]
GO
/****** Object:  StoredProcedure [dbo].[nkf_BadEmail_update]    Script Date: 05/21/2014 11:55:51 ******/
SET ANSI_NULLS OFF
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER OFF
GO
ALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[nkf_BadEmail_update] AS
set nocount on


Most others have:
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
GO
SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
GO

I tried fixing them in NKFBETA, but it won't let me save it, then I created a New Stored Procedure and made the changes and tried to save it, but it saved it to my local projects, not as a New Stored Procedure. I tried running this new stored procedure and got a "Command(s) completed successfully." response, but I tried to look for evidence of any changes made by searching for 'NKF_BADEMAIL_UPDATE' in 'Name_Log.User_ID', but the latest evidence of that was '2012-10-10 02:50:02.260', so I don't believe it updated anything.
